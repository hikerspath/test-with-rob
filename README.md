# Stuff To Learn

1. [Basic Git Course](https://lab.github.com) for code storage and version control (when you botch things)
   * If you like a bit more detail / instruction [Become a Git Expert in 4 Hours Or Less](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-expert-4-hours/)
   * If you like a bit more self-taught approach [Learn Git Version Control](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git)
3. Pick a language and learn the constructs of it
   * Classes and when to use them
   * Constants and ....
   * Functions
   * Libraries / Objects
   * Conditionals
   * Loops
   * etc2
  
# Developer Stuff

Not much in terms of tools here, I use repl.it a bunch for collaborative coding and while I'm not sure I would recommend vi to anyone that is just starting out, I have used it for code editing for decades and it is SUPER powerful (just a SUPER steep learning curve that I am still decades later adding to).  I do like toolsets like Visual Studio and have used IntelliJ before (stopped because it took up SOOOO many resources), but even inside these you will find me making vi my editor of choice.

  * Interpreters
  * Code Helpers
  * Snipits

## Base Languages & New Spinoffs

So every language comes from somewhere... [`C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages) was developed by Bell Labs back in the 60's? I want to say???  Anyway it was Bell Labs originating and at the time replaced other languages like PL/I and Fortran.  Though some of these languages would be greatly offended, they all grew from that line.  When I started out I learned C / C++ and perhaps you could say I've stuck to the same roots?

* C / C++
  * C#
  * Perl
  * csh
  * Go
  * Rust
  * Python
  * Swift
  * Java
    * JavaScript
    * NodeJS
    * Angluar
    * Groovy
* Basic
  * Visual Basic
  * .Net
* Pascal

## Full Stack Tools

So the languages will bring you to a point where you are able to build software, becoming a full-stack engineer will involve knowing not only how best to build the application but to host it in a highly available and fault tollerant manner as well.  Some of that will come with time, but the tools below are ones I still use to implement and maintain the software stacks I manage.

* https://terraform.io (Infrastructure as Code)
* https://serverless.com (End to end App Deployment: Python, NodeJS, etc)
* https://docker.com (Code in a Container)
* https://waypointproject.io (Deployment Automation)
* https://cloud.drone.io (CI/CD/Automation)
* https://n8n.io (Near Codeless Integration & Automation)
